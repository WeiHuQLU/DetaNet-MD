# DetaNet-MD
## Introduction
DetaNet-MD is a machine learning molecular dynamics framework that integrates the DetaNet model with velocity-Verlet and RPMD to simulate dynamic infrared and Raman spectra. It provides an efficient and transferable solution for real-time prediction of vibrational spectra and tensorial properties across diverse molecular and material systems.
